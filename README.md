# Star_Spectrum_Class_Predict


## Objectives :
Create a project using sales dataset and creating a Machine Learning project. In this project, I picked up Star_Spectrum_Class dataset from kaggle and applying 
different types Machine Learning algothims name as "LogisticRegression", "DecisionTree","RandomForest" classification algorithms after creates a model create UI (User Interface) for visualization a model prediction .

## About_Dataset :

About Dataset
Dataset Info:
This is a dataset consisting of several features of stars.

Some of them are:

* Absolute Temperature (in K)

* Relative Luminosity (L/Lo)
* Relative Radius (R/Ro)
Absolute Magnitude (Mv)
* Star Color (white,Red,Blue,Yellow,yellow-orange etc)
* Spectral Class (O,B,A,F,G,K,,M)
* Star Type **(Red Dwarf, Brown Dwarf, White Dwarf, * Main Sequence , SuperGiants, HyperGiants)**
**Lo** = 3.828 x 10^26 Watts (Avg Luminosity of Sun)

**Ro** = 6.9551 x 10^8 m (Avg Radius of Sun)


## Follow these approach for Data-Preprocessing :

This data can be used for simple tasks:

1. Data preprocessing.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Visualization.
4. Prediction using different classification algorithms and Model Evaluation.

dependent on these visualization select best algorithms and apply on model.


## Create User Interface and apply model on it:

## Goal :
Creating a Machine Learning Model using Logistic Regression to find the desirable output of stars_spectrum_class that show the Spectrum of stars when it have features that included on dataset.
